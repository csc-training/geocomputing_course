# CSC Geocomputing course

Work in progress: Course materials for Geocomputing course 2023

Materials are build to [Geocomputing course main page](https://csc-training.github.io/geocomputing_course) upon push to main (via PR).

Local testing can be done by installing [Sphinx](https://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/master/) and some extensions listed in the accompanying `environment.yml` file, cloning this repository and running `sphinx-build . _build` from within the repository directory (Note that `_build` directory should not be part of the github repository).
