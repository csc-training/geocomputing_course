# CSC Geocomputing course

Work in progress: Course materials for Geocomputing course 2023

Materials are build to [Geocomputing course main page](https://csc-training.github.io/geocomputing_course) upon push to main (via PR).

Local testing can be done by installing [Sphinx](https://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/master/) and some extensions with for example pip:

`pip install sphinx sphinx-book-theme myst_parser sphinx-togglebutton`

Then clone this repository and run 

`sphinx-build . _build` 

from within the repository directory (Note that `_build` directory should not be part of the github repository).
