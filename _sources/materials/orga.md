## Geoportti Research Infrastructure

Geoportti Research Infrastructure (RI) is a shared service for researchers, teachers and students using geospatial data and geocomputing tools. Geoportti RI helps researchers in Finland use, refine, preserve and share their geospatial resources.

* [GeoPortti web portal](https://www.geoportti.fi)
* GeoPortti (oGIIR) projects has been very important for developing geocomputing usage of CSC supercomputers and cloud services.
* GeoPortti services:
  * At CSC:
      * [Geocomputing services](https://research.csc.fi/geocomputing), inc. [supercomputer geospatial installations](software.md), [local spatial data](spatial_data_at_csc.md), [support](support.md) and [user-guides](https://docs.csc.fi/support/tutorials/#geoinformatics)
      * [Paituli data download service](https://paituli.csc.fi) with [STAC](stac.md)
      * [GIS training](https://research.csc.fi/gis-learning-materials) and [GIS seminars](https://research.csc.fi/geocomputing-seminars)
  * [GeoPortti GeoCubes](https://vm0160.kaj.pouta.csc.fi/geocubes/) - a harmonised, multi-resolution raster geodata repository containing several national datasets
  * [GeoPortti GeoPrivacy](https://geoprivacy.fi/#/) - a service where cyclists and pedestrians can donate GPS tracking data for science.
  * [UEF Drone Lab](https://www.geoportti.fi/tools/drones/)
  * [Geospatial Challenge Camp](https://challenge-camp.geoportti.fi/en/latest/) - a 10-week long challenge-based course (5 ECTS) that aims to provide participants a chance to tackle relevant real-world challenges in cross-disciplinary teams
