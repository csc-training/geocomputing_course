# Prerequisites

## Experience

To make this course as enjoyable as possible for you, and to make sure you can get something out of it, we expect you to know about the following:

* General understanding of geoinformatics, vector and raster data, coordinate systems.
* General understanding of either Python, R or use of command line tools, e.g. GDAL, PDAL, ...
* Basic Unix commands (know how to use these commands in a terminal): `cd, ls, mv, cp, rm, chmod, less, tail, echo, mkdir, pwd`. If you need to refresh these commands, read through the [Terminal](terminal.md) page.

This also means that this course is not an introduction to any of the topics above. Please refer to the [Where to go from here](where_to_go.md) for suggestions for further learning about the course topics.
