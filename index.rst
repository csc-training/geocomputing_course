Welcome to the course 
======================

Geocomputing on the supercomputer
=========================================================

* Are you working with geospatial data and running close to the limits of your own computing environment? 
* Are you curious on how you can take your geospatial data processing and analysis to the next level? 
* Or maybe you have been using a supercomputer already, but would like to make sure your are getting the most out of it?

→ This course is intended for you!

**In this course we will learn the basics of geocomputing on a supercomputer through a combination of lectures and hands-on activities.** The main focus of the course is CSC `Puhti supercomputer <https://research.csc.fi/-/puhti>`_, were all hands-on exercises will be done. The CSC services discussed in this course are free-of-charge for academic research, education and training purposes for Finnish higher education institutions and state research institutes (subsidized by the Ministry of Education and Culture, Finland). 

Most of the course content also applies to `EuroHPC JU LUMI supercomputer <https://www.lumi-supercomputer.eu/>`_, which is available for academic users and companies. 

The course is meant both for academic researchers planning to use Puhti supercomputer and for data analysts from private companies planning to use LUMI.

This course is organized by `CSC - IT Center for Science <https://www.csc.fi/>`_ and funded by `Geoportti Research Infrastructure <https://www.geoportti.fi/>`_ and the `Location Innvation Hub <https://locationinnovationhub.eu/en/home/>`_. 

## Course format

Hybrid course with lecture and hands-on exercises. It is recommended for online participants to have an extra screen available, to be able to follow the meeting, as well as the lecture materials and the Puhti webinterface. All questions should go to the collaborative document. This ensures fair chance for everyone to ask questions, and also to archive Q&A for everyone. During the exercise sessions we will in addition make use of red/green sticky notes on site and the "raise hand" feature in Zoom, if you run into trouble that needs immediate support.

All hands-on activities of this course can be carried out with [CSC's supercomputer Puhti's webinterface](https://puhti.csc.fi), which you can access via your favorite webbrowser. For this, you do not need any additional software installed on your own computer.

## Information overload

Depending on how you work with a computer, this course may bring you a lot of new information at once. Please do not get discouraged. This material will be available also after the course for your review. The best way to understand the concepts better is to start implementing your own work and ask for help when you have questions.

## Code of Conduct

We strive to follow the [Contributor Covenant Code of Conduct](https://www.contributor-covenant.org/) to foster an inclusive and welcoming environment for everyone.

In short:

* Use welcoming and inclusive language
* Be respectful of different viewpoints and experiences
* Gracefully accept constructive criticism
* Focus on what is best for the community
* Show courtesy and respect towards other community members
* Contact details to report CoC violations: katri.tegel@csc.fi

Furthermore, as this is a hands-on, interactive workshop:

* Be kind to each other and help each other as best you can.
* If you can’t help someone or there is some problem, let someone know.

Finally, if you notice something that prevents you from learning as well as you can, let us know and don’t suffer silently, even the “little things”:

* Volume too low?
* Font size too small?
* Generally confusing instructor?
* Not enough breaks?
