# Practicalities

## New materials

This is a new way for us to give this course, please excuse any small inconsistencies etc and give us feedback on how this works for you. 

## CSC account 

All hands-on activities of this course can be carried out with [CSC's supercomputer Puhti's webinterface](https://puhti.csc.fi), which you can access via your favorite webbrowser. For this, you do not need any additional software installed on your own computer.

For using Puhti, a [CSC account](https://docs.csc.fi/accounts/how-to-create-new-user-account/) is needed.

## Course format

Hybrid course with lecture and hands-on exercises. It is recommended for online participants to have an extra screen available, to be able to follow the meeting, as well as the lecture materials and the Puhti webinterface. All questions should go to the collaborative document. This ensures fair chance for everyone to ask questions, and also to archive Q&A for everyone.

## Information overload

Depending on how you work with a computer, this course may bring you a lot of new information at once. Please do not get discouraged. This material will be available also after the course for your review. The best way to understand the concepts better is to start implementing your own work and ask for help when you have questions.

## Starting point

There is much more to a supercomputer and the proper use of its resources than this course covers. If this got you interested, please check out our [CSC training calendar](https://www.csc.fi/en/training#training-calendar) for more advanced courses.

### Expectations

Course participant of 2023 answers summarized and categorized:

#### We will learn about ...

* All of the topics: Using Raster data, Vector data, Point cloud data,Geoportti resources, and Spatio Temporal Access Catalog (STAC) training on : CSC Puhti supercomputer, CSC Mahti supercomputer, LUMI supercomputer, CSC Pouta cloud
* Getting an insight into the supercomputing environment to have an idea how my research project could benefit
* Big raster/vector data GIS-analytics / Working with Spatial Big Data
* Efficient R scripting in CSC Puhti for geospatial data
* CSC general stuff, what things are there, how to use
* GIS/spatial possibilities with csc computers
* To improve my knowledge of spatial data processing
* Parallelization, high throughput
* Use of QGIS and other pre-installed GIS-software via the Puhti webinterface
* I am most interested to learn about how to flexibly customize the bash (*.sh) script for running array jobs and parallel computing in R through Puhti's compute node shell.
* Working with supercomputers / Enchance my skills about supercomputer
* Working with Allas
* Adapting own scripts to the supercomputer
* How to run own software in CSC supercomputer.

#### We will mention ...

* Using Geoportti and Paituli more efficiently
* Puhti configuration
* Using virtual rasters
* Setting up processing chains and running them on CSC services
* Learn how to use more computer tools and try to find its connction with geography.
* Processing point cloud data in Supercomputers

#### Not part of this course

* I want to learn about using Vector data such as different raster layer population density, rivers, and elevation and make this data resolution and projection comparable with the Climate model data sets.
* spatial econometrics
* How to use CSC for running deep learning for big raster data?
* Data Visualization
* Introduction and working with Taito. (Taito was the predecessor of Puhti :) ) 

### Python or R

75% of course participants (of 2023 edition) are more interested in learning how to use Python on supercomputer than R.

## Code of Conduct

We strive to follow the [Contributor Covenant Code of Conduct](https://www.contributor-covenant.org/) to foster an inclusive and welcoming environment for everyone.

In short:

* Use welcoming and inclusive language
* Be respectful of different viewpoints and experiences
* Gracefully accept constructive criticism
* Focus on what is best for the community
* Show courtesy and respect towards other community members
* Contact details to report CoC violations: katri.tegel@csc.fi

Furthermore, as this is a hands-on, interactive workshop:

* Be kind to each other and help each other as best you can.
* If you can’t help someone or there is some problem, let someone know.

Finally, if you notice something that prevents you from learning as well as you can, let us know and don’t suffer silently, even the “little things”:

* Volume too low?
* Font size too small?
* Generally confusing instructor?
* Not enough breaks?
