# Practicalities

## New materials

This is a new way for us to give this course, please excuse any small inconsistencies etc and give us feedback on how this works for you. 

## CSC account 

All hands-on activities of this course can be carried out with [CSC's supercomputer Puhti's webinterface](https://puhti.csc.fi), which you can access via your favorite webbrowser. For this, you do not need any additional software installed on your own computer.

For using Puhti, a [CSC account](https://docs.csc.fi/accounts/how-to-create-new-user-account/) is needed.

## Course format

Hybrid course with lecture and hands-on exercises. It is recommended for online participants to have an extra screen available, to be able to follow the meeting, as well as the lecture materials and the Puhti webinterface. All questions should go to the collaborative document. This ensures fair chance for everyone to ask questions, and also to archive Q&A for everyone.

## Information overload

Depending on how you work with a computer, this course may bring you a lot of new information at once. Please do not get discouraged. This material will be available also after the course for your review. The best way to understand the concepts better is to start implementing your own work and ask for help when you have questions.

## Starting point

There is much more to a supercomputer and the proper use of its resources than this course covers. If this got you interested, please check out our [CSC training calendar](https://www.csc.fi/en/training#training-calendar) for more advanced courses.
