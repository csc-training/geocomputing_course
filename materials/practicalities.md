# Practicalities

## Course format

Hybrid course with lecture and hands-on exercises. It is recommended for online participants to have an extra screen available, to be able to follow the meeting, as well as the lecture materials and the Puhti webinterface. All questions should go to the collaborative document. This ensures fair chance for everyone to ask questions, and also to archive Q&A for everyone. During the exercise sessions we will in addition make use of red/green sticky notes on site and the "raise hand" feature in Zoom, if you run into trouble that needs immediate support.

## Information overload

Depending on how you work with a computer, this course may bring you a lot of new information at once. Please do not get discouraged. This material will be available also after the course for your review. The best way to understand the concepts better is to start implementing your own work and ask for help when you have questions.

## Code of Conduct

We strive to follow the [Contributor Covenant Code of Conduct](https://www.contributor-covenant.org/) to foster an inclusive and welcoming environment for everyone.

In short:

* Use welcoming and inclusive language
* Be respectful of different viewpoints and experiences
* Gracefully accept constructive criticism
* Focus on what is best for the community
* Show courtesy and respect towards other community members
* Contact details to report CoC violations: katri.tegel@csc.fi

Furthermore, as this is a hands-on, interactive workshop:

* Be kind to each other and help each other as best you can.
* If you can’t help someone or there is some problem, let someone know.

Finally, if you notice something that prevents you from learning as well as you can, let us know and don’t suffer silently, even the “little things”:

* Volume too low?
* Font size too small?
* Generally confusing instructor?
* Not enough breaks?
