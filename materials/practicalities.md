# Practicalities

## CSC account 

All hands-on activities of this course can be carried out with [CSC's supercomputer Puhti's webinterface](https://puhti.csc.fi), which you can access via your favorite webbrowser. For this, you do not need any additional software installed on your own computer.

For using Puhti, a [CSC account](https://docs.csc.fi/accounts/how-to-create-new-user-account/) is needed.

You will also need to have access to a CSC project. For the course version, we will use a course project (`project_2008648`) provided by CSC which you got access to by providing your username to us through the pre course survey. If you haven't done so, please share your CSC username in the collaborative document. The course project will also give you access to a resource reservation (on Thursday: `geocomputing_thu` , on Friday: `geocomputing_fri`).

Let's all check now at [https://my.csc.fi](https://my.csc.fi) that you see the course project, and have accepted the terms and conditions of Puhti and Allas. We will need this later.

## Course format

Hybrid course with lecture and hands-on exercises. It is recommended for online participants to have an extra screen available, to be able to follow the meeting, as well as the lecture materials and the Puhti webinterface. All questions should go to the collaborative document. This ensures fair chance for everyone to ask questions, and also to archive Q&A for everyone. During the exercise sessions we will in addition make use of red/green sticky notes on site and the "raise hand" feature in Zoom, if you run into trouble that needs immediate support.

## Information overload

Depending on how you work with a computer, this course may bring you a lot of new information at once. Please do not get discouraged. This material will be available also after the course for your review. The best way to understand the concepts better is to start implementing your own work and ask for help when you have questions.

## Starting point

There is much more to a supercomputer and the proper use of its resources than this course covers. If this got you interested, please check out our [CSC training calendar](https://www.csc.fi/en/training#training-calendar) for more advanced courses.

## Code of Conduct

We strive to follow the [Contributor Covenant Code of Conduct](https://www.contributor-covenant.org/) to foster an inclusive and welcoming environment for everyone.
