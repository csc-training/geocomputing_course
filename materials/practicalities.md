# Practicalities

All hands-on activities of this course can be carried out with [CSC's supercomputer Puhti's webinterface](https://puhti.csc.fi), which you can access via your favorite webbrowser. For this, you do not need any additional software installed on your own computer.

For using Puhti, a [CSC account](https://docs.csc.fi/accounts/how-to-create-new-user-account/) is needed.

* Be respectful of different viewpoints and experiences
* Gracefully accept constructive criticism
* Focus on what is best for the community

Finally, if you notice something that prevents you from learning as well as you can, let us know and don’t suffer silently, even the “little things”:

* Volume too low?
