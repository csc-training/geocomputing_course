# Prerequisites

## Experience

To make this course as enjoyable as possible for you and to make sure you can get something out of it, we expect you to know about the following:

* General understanding of geoinformatics, vector and raster data, coordinate systems.
* General understanding of either Python, R or use of command line tools, e.g. GDAL, PDAL, ...
* Basic Unix commands (know how to use these commands in a terminal): `cd, ls, mv, cp, rm, chmod, less, tail, echo, mkdir, pwd`.
    * Here are some resources to acquire these skills:
        * [UNIX tutorial for beginners](http://www.ee.surrey.ac.uk/Teaching/Unix/) (the first two topics are a good start, try also some editor)
        * [Basic Linux Commands 10 min tutorial video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uFPly_nGBMg) (sit back and watch)
        * [CSC and Linux Cheat Sheet](./cheatsheet.md) (one page summary of the most important Linux commands – handy to have near you during the course)
        * [Terminal intro](terminal.md)

This also means that this course is not an introduction to either of the topics. Please refer to other courses to learn more about the topics that interest you.
