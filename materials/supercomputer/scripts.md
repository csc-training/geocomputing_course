# Harnessing the power

Supercomputer != laptop

## GUI -> script

> Interactive usage is limited in resources. The real power comes from parallelization for which we will need to write scripts.
> Scripts capture what needs to be done in text format and make it understandable for the computer to work with.
> Usage of scripts over GUI also increases reproducibility of your work.
> Demo e.g. Getting GDAL commands from QGIS

## CLI, Python, R

> Simple usecases may be sufficiently run with command line tools only. More complicated workflows can be implemented in any programming language of your choice. If you do not know any, we recommend you start with Python.
> Googling your usecase may provide an overview if there is Python or R packages or command line tools are available for your usecase.
