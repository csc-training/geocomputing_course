# Terminology

- You can roughly think that one **node** is a single computer
- A node on a supercomputer contains:
  - One or more central processing units (**CPUs**) with many **cores**
  - Shared **memory**
- Some nodes may also have:
  - **Local storage**
  - Graphics processing units (**GPUs**)


- Login nodes are used to set up jobs (and to launch them)
- Jobs are run on the compute nodes
- A batch job system (scheduler) is used to run and manage the jobs
  - On CSC machines, we use Slurm
