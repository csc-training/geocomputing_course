## Connecting to the supercomputer via SSH

We have accessed the supercomputer via the webinterface in order to not overwhelm you with setups before the course. However, this way may not always be the most convenient. If you want to access the supercomputer from your terminal directly, you will have to set up SSH keys:

:class: seealso, dropdown

**Login with SSH**

- SSH is a terminal program that gives you command-line access on the CSC supercomputer
- It is a versatile main interface to a supercomputer
   - Laptop &harr; Toyota, Supercomputer &harr; F1. F1 needs a specialist interface.
- Please read this page for an introduction on [how to log in with SSH](https://docs.csc.fi/computing/connecting/)
   - Mac and Linux have SSH. On Windows, Powershell can be used, but we recommend the Puhti web interface, or clients like MobaXterm or PuTTY
   - Note the [prerequisites to be able to access Puhti](https://docs.csc.fi/support/faq/how-to-get-puhti-access/)
- Plain SSH will not allow displaying remote graphics
   - Puhti web interface is often best for this, but can be enabled also by X11-tunneling (additional installations required on Windows, see link above)

**Setting up SSH keys**

- Using SSH keys is easier and safer than using a password with every login
- SSH keys can be easily used in Windows, Mac, Linux
- Consult our [tutorials on how to set up SSH keys for your account](https://docs.csc.fi/computing/connecting/#setting-up-ssh-keys)
   - [Logging in to LUMI](https://docs.lumi-supercomputer.eu/firststeps/getstarted/) requires setting up an SSH key pair and registering the public key in [My CSC](https:/my.csc.fi)

## How you can help


If you used any of our resources for your research, please acknowledge CSC and Geoportti in your publications, it is important for project continuation and funding reports. As an example, you can write:

> "The authors wish to thank CSC - IT Center for Science, Finland (urn:nbn:fi:research-infras-2016072531) and the Open Geospatial Information Infrastructure for Research (Geoportti, urn:nbn:fi:research-infras-2016072513) for computational resources and support".

## "Geo" seminars

Find all materials of previous seminars on our [CSC research pages](https://research.csc.fi/geocomputing-seminars).

Next CSC "geo" seminar will be in beginning of 2024: "Machine Learning with spatial data".

## Get to know weekly user support session

Come to chat with our specialists about anything related to CSC resources! 
Special invite to you for 18.10 at 14, but we keep these sessions every week.
Sometimes with short talks about interesting topics.
