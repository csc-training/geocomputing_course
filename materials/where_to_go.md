# Where to go from here

Computing course project available until 20.10.23

## Connecting to the supercomputer via SSH

We have accessed the supercomputer via the webinterface in order to not overwhelm you with setups before the course. However, this way may not always be the most convenient. You can also directly connect your computer to the supercomputer via SSH.

:::{admonition} Connecting with SSH clients
:class: seealso, dropdown

- SSH clients give command-line access to a supercomputer or any other Linux server.
- Basic SSH connection will not allow displaying remote graphics, but it is possible to set up with extra settings, but in case of Puhti web interface is recommended.
- SSH clients:
   - Mac and Linux have Terminal for SSH connections.
   - In Windows:
      - `Command Prompt` or `Powershell` are always avaialbe and can be used for basic connections.
      - Special tools like [PuTTY](https://www.putty.org/) or [MobaXterm](https://mobaxterm.mobatek.net/) provide more options, inc possibility to save settings, but need installation.
